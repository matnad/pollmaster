- Polls are persistent and will be available until you delete them
- Personalised info for each poll by reacting with ❔

| pm!userrole <any role> | Set the role that has the rights to use the bot    |

## Getting Started

Users with the server permission "Manage Server" will have all rights from the start, meaning you can get started with pm!new right away!

To grant users without "Manage Server" poll creation access to the bot, create and distribute the role *polladmin* or *polluser*. If you already have roles for these rights you can tell the bot by typing *pm!adminrole <your role>* and *pm!userrole <your role>*.
