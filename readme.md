## Overview

With Pollmaster you can very easily create and manage complex polls on your server. 

Here is a quick list of features:

- Voting works with reactions (users don't need to type anything)
- Anonymous voting is possible!
- Polls can be single choice, multiple choice or restricted to a specific number of choices
- You can prepare polls in advance and schedule them to a date and time or manually activate them
- Polls can be given a deadline or they can be open until closed manually
- You can restrict which roles are allowed to participate
- You can assign weights to roles to count their votes more or less
- You can hide the current vote count to prevent sheeping
- Polls are persistent and will be available until you delete them
- Personalised info for each poll by reacting with ❔
- Everything can be done in private chat with the bot to reduce spam on the server
- Full multi-server support!
- For advanced users: Commandline support to create a full poll in one line -> pm!cmd help

| pm!userrole <any role> | Set the role that has the rights to use the bot    |

## Getting Started

Users with the server permission "Manage Server" will have all rights from the start, meaning you can get started with pm!new right away!

To grant users without "Manage Server" poll creation access to the bot, create and distribute the role *polladmin* or *polluser*. If you already have roles for these rights you can tell the bot by typing *pm!adminrole <your role>* and *pm!userrole <your role>*.
